# Getting Started

To get started with the package, first install the requirements in a fresh venv (preferably conda) using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then build the project using 

```bash
pip install -e .
```

There are built-in pytest unit tests to ensure the installation works correctly. From the base directory, simply run

```bash
pytest
```

The output should show each test's output and hopefully no errors should occur!

Now you can use the cli commands to run the project in a Python session. Examples of usage of the important functions in the package are included in the example notebook.
