# Getting Started

To get started with the package, first install the requirements in a fresh venv (preferrably conda) using

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

And then build the toml using 

```pip install -e .```

There are built in pytest unit tests to make sure everything is working correctly. From the base directory, simply run

```pytest```

The output should show each test's output and hopefully no errors should occur!

Now you can use the cli commands to run the project in a python instance.
